# TMD-ResNet-Model
A nowcast deep learning model trained by CHAMP.
The purpose of constructing this model is to effectively extract the features of Thermospheric mass density (TMD) from CHAMP observation, and further promote the thermosphere-ionosphere coupling research.

# Data
The training data were obtained fromï¼š
1. https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/dx1.html - f10.7
2. https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/omni_min.html - SYM-H, AE
3. http://tinyurl.com/densitysets - CHAMP TMD

# Prerequisites
1. Python 3.9
2. tensorflow 2
3. PyYaml

# Installation
`git clone https://github.com/Soulboy1234/TMD-ResNet-Model.git`

# Reference
The more detailed has been submitted to AGU: Space Weather and is under review.
